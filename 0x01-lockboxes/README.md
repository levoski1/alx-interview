# Lockboxes Project

## Overview

The **Lockboxes** project is a Python script designed to determine whether all boxes can be unlocked given an initial set of locked boxes and keys. The problem is solved using a stack-based approach, where each box may contain keys to unlock other boxes.

## Requirements

- **Python version**: The code is written for Python 3 and has been tested on Python 3.4.3.
- **Operating System**: The code will be interpreted and executed on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.

## Installation

To run the script on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or create a local directory and add the `canUnlockAll.py` file.
2. Ensure that your Python version is at least 3.4.3.
3. Make the script executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x canUnlockAll.py
